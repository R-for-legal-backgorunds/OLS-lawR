# OLS-lawR
This is a project that focuses on Why R, for those with legal backgrounds using examples from South Africa. 

This project is envisioned as one that ends up as something that can explain the “why” when encouraging people from legal backgrounds to learn R and some data science. The idea is to get to that point by using 1-3 different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a platform with a few examples of practical use and application as well as code to encourage such persons to see the "why"before the "how".

Data, data science, and science are words/fields that often do not feel accessible, useful or necessary to many law students and law graduates. It is difficult to see why learning R programming is useful without relateable outcomes as examples. My view is that there is merit in showing its usefulness as a research tool or for analysis before starting with intro to R training. R is a tool that is not taught in undergraduate university law programs (as far as I am aware) in South Africa. The problem that I want to solve is the gap between young legal researchers, students or graduates and their ability to relate to and see the potential for learning data science skills or R basics in addition to and complementary to their legal education. 

I am most inspired to work openly in research by the reality that so many people lose out on opportunities to learn, contribute and apply research that is not open. I have personally gained a lot from open research shared by others and I would like to contribute in my own way as well. 

# Project status
At this stage I have a great idea, and I am working towards launching a first prototype. 

# TL;DR
An open resource that illustrates why R is a useful tool to learn for those with legal backgrounds in both legal research and practice
