<p>This is a project that focuses on Why R, for those with legal backgrounds using examples from South Africa.</p>
<p>This project is envisioned as one that ends up as something that can explain the “why” when encouraging people from legal backgrounds to learn R and some data science. The idea is to get to that point by using 1-3 different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a platform with a few examples of practical use and application as well as code to encourage such persons to see the “why”before the “how”.</p>
<p>Data, data science, and science are words/fields that often do not feel accessible, useful or necessary to many law students and law graduates. It is difficult to see why learning R programming is useful without relateable outcomes as examples. My view is that there is merit in showing its usefulness as a research tool or for analysis before starting with intro to R training. R is a tool that is not taught in undergraduate university law programs (as far as I am aware) in South Africa. The problem that I want to solve is the gap between young legal researchers, students or graduates and their ability to relate to and see the potential for learning data science skills or R basics in addition to and complementary to their legal education.</p>
<p>I am most inspired to work openly in research by the reality that so many people lose out on opportunities to learn, contribute and apply research that is not open. I have personally gained a lot from open research shared by others and I would like to contribute in my own way as well.</p>
